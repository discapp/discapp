# Disc Golf App
Team project for Brandeis RSEG 172 Cloud Computing

Our proposal to management is to pilot a cloud-based solution using our disc golf league tracking software feature. This league package combines many of the software features and elements which we believe will have more value in the cloud: ability to more readily scale UI performance based on number of users, integration with geolocation data to track user-created courses, social media integration, team rankings and analytics, and lower TCO relative to self-hosted equipment. We will pilot these features and demonstrate greater value, flexibility, and scalability with a cloud-based solution.
